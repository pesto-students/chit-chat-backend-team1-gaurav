# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
